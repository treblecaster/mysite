To Do:

 - Why is it that I have to use the address 'http://127.0.0.1:8000//hello/'
   instead of 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/' to get to my hello world page?

 - Figure out how to automatically turn off debug mode when hosted in a
   production environment, so that 404 errors don't give away too much info.
